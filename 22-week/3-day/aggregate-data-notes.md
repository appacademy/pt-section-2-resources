# Aggregate Data

## Define aggregate data and describe an example:

Aggregate data refers to summarized or combined information derived from individual data points. It involves applying a function (e.g., sum, average, count) to a set of raw data to obtain condensed insights. For example, in a sales database, aggregate data could include the total revenue for a specific month or the average number of products sold per day.

## Lazy load aggregate data using two different approaches:

Lazy loading is a strategy where data is loaded only when it is actually needed, optimizing resource usage. Two approaches for lazy loading aggregate data are:

a. On-Demand Computation: Calculate the aggregate data dynamically when requested, ensuring it's always up-to-date. This approach can be resource-intensive.

b. Precomputed Tables or Materialized Views: Pre-calculate and store aggregate data in dedicated tables or views, updating them periodically. This reduces computation time at the cost of potentially using more storage.
Evaluate the pros and cons of storing aggregate data in the database vs. querying for the data when needed:

### Storing in the Database:

Pros:
Faster Retrieval: Precomputed data allows for quicker responses to queries.
Reduced Computation Load: Calculations are done in advance, saving processing power during runtime.

Cons:
Increased Storage: Storing precomputed data can lead to larger database sizes.
Potentially Outdated: If not regularly updated, the stored aggregates may become stale.

### Querying for Data When Needed:

Pros:
Lower Storage Requirements: Only raw data is stored, minimizing storage needs.
Real-Time Updates: Ensures that the latest information is always retrieved.

Cons:
Slower Query Performance: Aggregations must be calculated on the fly, potentially causing delays.
Higher Computational Load: Calculations are done at runtime, consuming more processing resources.
