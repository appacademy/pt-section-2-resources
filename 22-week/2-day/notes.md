# Order Query Results

Ordering is crucial in database queries as it determines the arrangement of results, providing clarity and relevance. In the context of Sequelize, a Node.js ORM, three approaches to ordering results are commonly used:

### Using the order Key:

The order key in Sequelize allows specifying the sorting order for query results based on a single attribute.
For example, ordering a list of books by their publication year:
```
Book.findAll({
  order: [['publicationYear', 'ASC']],
});
```

### Ordering by Multiple Attributes:

To sort results by multiple attributes, an array of attribute-order pairs can be provided in the order key.
For instance, sorting books first by genre in ascending order and then by publication year in descending order:
```
Book.findAll({
  order: [['genre', 'ASC'], ['publicationYear', 'DESC']],
});
```

### Ordering by Association:

When dealing with associated models, ordering can be applied based on attributes from the associated model.
Example: Ordering authors by the titles of their books' publication years in ascending order:
```
Author.findAll({
  include: [{ model: Book, order: [['publicationYear', 'ASC']]}],
});
```

In summary, ordering enhances result presentation and relevance. Sequelize's flexibility allows developers to employ various ordering strategies, from single-attribute ordering to more complex scenarios involving multiple attributes and associations.
