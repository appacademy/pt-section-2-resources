# Express Middleware


## Middleware Overview:

- Express middleware consists of functions with access to req, res, and the next middleware in the request-response cycle.
- Express applications are a series of middleware function calls.

<br/>

## Anatomy of Middleware Function:

- Middleware functions take three arguments: req, res, and next.
- The order is crucial: req, res, next.
- Example: const logTime = (req, res, next) => { ... }.

## Series of Middleware Functions:

- Express applications involve a series of middleware function calls.
- Middleware functions can be bound to app routes using app.use() or specific HTTP methods.

<br/>


## Middleware Function Interaction:

- Middleware functions interact in a series, invoked in the order they are specified.

<br/>

## Variation for Invoking Middleware:

- Middleware functions can be passed as separate arguments or as an array.
- The order of middleware functions in the array matters.

<br/>

## Application-Level Middleware:

- Middleware functions can be set at the application level using app.use().
- Application-level middleware runs for every route and simplifies execution for multiple routes.

<br/>

In summary, Express middleware plays a crucial role in handling the request-response cycle. Understanding the order of middleware execution, utilizing middleware functions, and implementing application-level middleware contribute to building a robust Express server.
