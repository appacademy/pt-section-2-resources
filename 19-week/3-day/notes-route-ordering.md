# Route Order Matters!

## Importance of Route Order:

- Express processes routes in the order they appear in the code.
- The first matching route for an incoming request is immediately executed.

<br/>

## Problem with Incorrect Order:

- Duplicate routes or similar starting routes can lead to unintended behavior.
- Incorrect order may result in only the first matching route being executed.

<br/>

## Solution - Order Matters:

- Proper way is to order routes from most specific to generic.

<br/>

## Best Practices for Route Order:

### 1. Order from Specific to Generic:
Arrange routes based on specificity to avoid overshadowing by more generic ones.

### 2. Group Similar Paths:
Keep similar paths together for better readability and maintenance.
