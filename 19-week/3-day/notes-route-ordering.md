# Route Order Matters!

## Importance of Route Order:

Express processes routes in the order they appear in the code.
The first matching route for an incoming request is immediately executed.


## Problem with Incorrect Order:

Duplicate routes or similar starting routes can lead to unintended behavior.
Incorrect order may result in only the first matching route being executed.
Example of Incorrect Order:

Demonstrated with routes starting with /hello and /goodbye.
Illustrated how a more specific route can overshadow others if not ordered correctly.


## Solution - Order Matters:

Proper way is to order routes from most specific to generic.
Illustrated a correct order for similar routes, prioritizing specificity.


## Best Practices for Route Order:

### 1. Order from Specific to Generic:
Arrange routes based on specificity to avoid overshadowing by more generic ones.

### 2. Group Similar Paths:
Keep similar paths together for better readability and maintenance.
