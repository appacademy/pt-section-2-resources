# M4 Project

## Purpose
- Create a backend for the upcoming Mod 5 frontend project
- Gain a better understanding of data shaping
- Improve debugging skills
- Test their accumulated knowledge
- Emulate a real-world project sprint


## What You'll Be Doing/Some Expectations
Creating Sequelize Models/Migrations & validations
Creating Express API Routes
Sending requests with Postman & returning the appropriate response
Planning and efficient time management
Asking SWE-level questions
Proper git workflow and repository management

## Some Other Tips

- Students should use the Req/Res of the API Docs to inform their DB Schema creation
- Routes with “include” queries tend to throw students off when creating DB schemas
- Remind students that a key appearing in the response of a route doesn’t guarantee that key exists on that route’s table
