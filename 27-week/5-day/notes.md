# Hooks

## React Components are `Pure Functions`

### ...what's a pure function again?

- The same input always returns the same output
- Running the function does not cause any `side effects`
  - Running this function affects how another function will run
    - Even itself!

```js
let myNumber = 5;

// Pure function
const pure = (num) => {
  return num + 5;
};

pure(myNumber); // 10
console.log(myNumber); // 5

// Function causing a side effect

const impure = () => {
  myNumber += 5;
  return myNumber;
};

impure(); // 10
console.log(myNumber); // 10
```

### Regular Functional Components **_should not produce side effects_**

### Instead, side effects should be fully controlled through hooks

Hooks are a way for us to update content on the page that will persist through rerenders

This will NOT persist data through refreshes

## `useState()`

`useState()` takes any value and returns an array with two values

- The value you pass will be what the state's value starts as
- Index 0 in the array is the current value for the state
- Index 1 in the array is the function to update the state

Since `useState()` returns an array, we can easily save each value into variables using destructuring

- These can be named absolutely anything!
- Convention says to name the second variable `set`-FirstVariable

```js
const [input, setInput] = useState("Please provide a phone number");
const [maxNumPassengers, setMaxNumPassengers] = useState(80);
```

The state value should never be directly changed.

Instead, use the update function to change the state's value

```js
import { useState } from 'react';

const EatFruit = () => {
    const [numFruits, setNumFruits] = useState(10);

    return (
    // Pretend there's JSX here that lets a user eat an apple

    ...
    // BAD CODE DON'T DO THIS
    numFruits = numFruits - 1

    ...
    // Correctly changing state
    setNumFruits(numFruits - 1)
  )
};
```

## `useEffect()`

Handles anything you want to happen after a rerender occurs

`useEffect` takes two arguments, a callback function and a dependency array

```js
useEffect(() => {}, []);
```

The function is the action you want to happen on every render.

The array is what useEffect is "watching".

- useEffect will only run the function if any values inside of the array have changed
  - Think of this similarly to React's Virtual DOM and the real DOM
  - React will only update the real DOM with the changes made to the Virtual
  - useEffect will only run its function if a change has occurred to the array values
- An empty dependency array will cause the useEffect to run after the initial render ONLY
- No dependency array will cause useEffect to run after initial render and on EVERY subsequent rerender
