## Lore Drop: SQL Pronunciation
Structured Query Language, is commonly abbreviated to SQL.  This begs the question, "how does one pronounce: 'SQL'"

The most common and correct pronunciations are:
  - "S", "Q", "L" -- most correct.
  - "Sequel" -- widly accepted.

But, for those aiming for effieceiency in all aspects of their lives, you can cut 3 or 2 syllabols down to 1 by opting for the less common, but highly efficient pronunciation: "Squel".
  - This is similar to how it's more efficient to say "world wide web" instead of "W" "W" W"
  - Use this sparingly and ideally only around others who are also efficiency optimizers -- it's like being in a club.

*Disclaimer: this is a joke.  Do not argue in an interview that "squel" is more effiecient, and therefore more correct.  Please use your professional judgment for where and when to use the more efficient pronunciation.*
