# Welcome to your first day of the Mod 4 API Project!

## Assessment details

## Project Expectations

- Your project must pass 100% of the specs
- You must work on the project alone
  - No more hanging out in zoom rooms together
  - Collaboration in discord question threads is allowed and encouraged!
- You must create branches for features
  - Coding on `main` is forbidden, except for fixing deployment errors
    - Even then it's not recommended
  - Creating a branch for errors is the easiest way to get help on errors

## Asking questions

- Not allowed to ask us to join your room
  - We may join rooms at our discretion, usually for deployment errors
- You should not ask a question without first checking the FAQ tag
  - Also make use of other tags to view any similar issues
  - Start searching where you'll find the most relevant answer
- Questions must be asked in the discord channel
  - Title should be
    - 1-line error message if error
    - 1-line description if no error
  - Post should have
    - Link to your github repo branch with error (required)

    - Descriptions/screenshots of the problem/relevant info
  - Tags must include
    - `New`
    - `API Project`
    - Any of the other most relevant tags

## Project Grading

- Postman collections exist to help you grade
  - Using them is not necessary to pass, but they will help you stay organized
- You can only run Postman collections 25 times per month without paying
  - This means you SHOULD NOT BE RUNNING COLLECTIONS TO TEST FEATURES
  - Collections should only be run to test the ENTIRE site at once
- You are allowed ONE project review
  - We will test your live project and verify if you're currently passing or failing
  - You shouldn't need us to do this at all since you can run the collection yourself
  - If you are told you're passing, that DOES NOT GUARANTEE that you pass on the due date
    - If you choose to add more features to your project, and that breaks it, you will fail

## Difference Between Postman Collections

- The Basic Collection should be used to
  - Test individual specs
  - Check for request data edge cases
- The Comprehensive Collection should be used to
  - Test your entire application from start to finish
